        <p>
          A full-stack web application I created from scratch using MERN stack.
          It is an application that gives users recommendations on what to watch
          based on their movie/tv show preferences.

          This was my final project during my time as a student at Ironhack,
          where I worked on it from front to back solo in 1.5 weeks.
